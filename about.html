	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Brent Garner and I am a software engineer in Calgary, Alberta. I do a lot of work in PHP these days, but I have worked with Java in the past. I am mainly focussed on building large-scale webapps. I like to think of myself as a bit of a "jack of all traades", even though I really hate that term. I also donâ€™t like the term "full-stack developer". I guess I want to be known as a guy who can figure stuff out and deliver, more than anything.</p>
	
	<h2>What's Happening Here</h2>
	<p>I've always loved <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham's blog</a>, mostly for the fact that it isn't a blog at all. It's just a site with some essays that make a lot of sense. I don't like the sameness of all of the blogs with their wordpress plugins and banner ads. I just like that Paul's content is front and centre.</p>

	<p>I'm not saying I can write like Paul. But this is my attempt to build something like he's built. The only way to get better is to write. So, I guess those are the main goals here: to write, to learn, to share.</p>
