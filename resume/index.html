								<h2>FGL Sports Ltd.</h2>
								<h3>Lead Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
								<h4>2011-Present</h4>
								<p>
									I am lead developer on the FGL Flagship Store projects. I built the Community Board application, the Cash Wall application and management backends for both. I wrote the system for ingesting and serving live sports scores to the stores, in various apps, and to be displayed on "power rings" in store. I also developed several Android tablet apps used in the stores. I worked with various vendors and CTi (Canadian Tire Innovations) out of Waterloo, ON to oversee the development and delivery of various applications.</p>
							<p>
									<strong>West Edmonton Mall:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Li6IGUK_4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Li6IGUK_4</a><br />
									<strong>Toronto Yonge Street: </strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JfIoe9OI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6_JfIoe9OI</a>
									
								</p>
								<p>I created FGL's product information system for holding product descriptions, features/benefits, brand, and sport/activity categorization. Previous to this, FGL was using Excel spreadsheets to manage this information, leading to a lot of out-dated data and conflicting versions of product data. My cloud application provides the enterprise with one source of truth, and allows for data entry teams to work in Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto. It integrates into a number of other systems, as well as our apps in store, and on our e-commerce site (<a href="http://sportchek.ca">http://sportchek.ca</a>).
								</p>
								<p>
									I also developed the succession planning tool (like an internal LinkedIn) used by FGL operations, which serves 14,000+ users. I developed the 'ProLab', a streaming video site and Android tablet app used to serve video produced in-house by our training department.</p>
									
								<p>As the Lead Developer, I provide mentorship to other less experienced developers on our team.</p>
